## 1. Overview and Purpose

The complete three-dimensional model of the robot's structure was designed in the online environment **TinkerCAD**. The model includes the chassis, as well as all necessary mounts and spaces for placing electronic components (Arduino, L298N driver, OLED display, HC-SR04).

**Goal:** To ensure the possibility of accurate reproduction of the mechanical part of the project.

## 2. Key Structural Elements

The model accounts for and fixes the following elements:

* **Chassis:** The main platform for mounting all components.
* **Mounts for Arduino UNO and L298N:** Ensure secure fixation of the control electronics.
* **HC-SR04 Holder:** Positioned at the front for accurate distance measurement.
* **OLED Display Mount:** Ensures visibility of the display for visual debugging and monitoring.
* **Motor Holes:** Account for the size of the motors and axles.
